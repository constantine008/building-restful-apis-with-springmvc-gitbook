**REST** is the abbreviation of *Representational State Transfer*. The term **REST** was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, [Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm).
